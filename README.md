# Student--Design-User-Interaction-Project

In this project, my teammates and I effectively designed interactive interfaces prototypes for web and mobile platforms, emphasizing a positive user experience. Our initiative centered around creating a prototype app (Student+) designed to optimize productivity for students, incorporating user interviews, rigorous testing, and subsequent improvements. Additionally, we extended the project by developing a tablet-specific prototype of the app to cater to diverse user preferences and devices
